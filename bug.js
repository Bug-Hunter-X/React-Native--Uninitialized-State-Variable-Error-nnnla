This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized. This commonly happens in functional components before the first render.  It might manifest as `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'this.state.myVariable')` or similar.  It also shows up when using asynchronous operations, where you attempt to use the state before the asynchronous call completes.
