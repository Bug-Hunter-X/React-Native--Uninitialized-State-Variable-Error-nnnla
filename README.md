# React Native Uninitialized State Variable Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native applications: attempting to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often leads to unexpected behavior and crashes, typically manifesting as `undefined is not an object` errors.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version.

## Bug Description

The bug occurs when accessing `this.state.myVariable` (or a similar state variable) before React has had a chance to initialize it.  This commonly happens in the initial render of a functional component or when dealing with asynchronous operations where the state update is not yet complete.

## Solution

The solution involves using conditional rendering or the optional chaining operator (`?.`) to check if the state variable is defined before accessing it.  The updated code ensures that the application handles the case where `this.state.myVariable` is undefined gracefully.
